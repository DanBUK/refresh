# Refresh REST/Webdav for node

This project will be a module that exposes ANY data source as HTTP.  The goals are as follows:

 - Implement GET/PUT/POST/DELETE as described in <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer>
 - Implement enough of WebDav to enable mounting read/write in Finder
 - Further implement WebDav for other clients as time allows and need arises.

The main goal is to make a simple resource provider for web-apps and other http clients.  This will work, but not be tied to [node-persistence][]
